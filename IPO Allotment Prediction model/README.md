# IPO Allotment Prediction Model

## Project Description

Built a model to predict IPO allotment chances using features like oversubscription rate, investor category, and issue size. To provide probabilistic insights despite the lottery-based system.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw and cleaned datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and model development.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data cleaning, model training, and deployment.
- `app/`: Contains the deployed model (e.g., Streamlit or Flask app).

## Tasks

- [ ] Data Visualization – Explore and present your data clearly using appropriate charts and plots.
- [ ] Feature Analysis – Identify and analyze the most relevant features for your model.
- [ ] Model Building – Develop at least one machine learning model to address your problem statement.
- [ ] Hyperparameter Tuning – Optimize your model's performance through proper tuning techniques.
- [ ] Model Comparison – Compare the performance of different models using suitable evaluation metrics.
- [ ] Deployment – Deploy your final model using any suitable platform or framework (e.g., Streamlit, Flask, etc.).
- [ ] Documentation - Ensure the project is well-documented.
